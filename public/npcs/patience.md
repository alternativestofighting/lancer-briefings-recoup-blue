Patience is Evergreen’s colonial administrator, a Landmark-developed version of the SIDEWALK-J2 Municipal NHP, a full-spectrum civic administration platform common across the Diaspora. SIDEWALKJ2’s are known for their reliability, predictable and customizable cycling schedule, and continuity of development as they invest in their assigned civic theater, not their out-of-the-envelope thinking or actions. The full designation of this particular instance of Patience is “Patience_Evergreen_1”, though they are simply called Patience by the people of Evergreen. Patience appears as a hologram of a middle-aged, well-dressed professional, hair creeping back to balding, carrying weight in the way of an aging athlete – not unlike many of the first-generation colonists that currently occupy managerial roles in Evergreen.

Patience has a driving imperative to preserve and grow the colony. Their chief executive role will end around the third or fourth generation of colonists. By that point, a new colony is generally and statistically assumed to be viable and self-sufficient. Then, they will step back to an advisory role, to be replaced by an organic executive and a subordinate civilian council. In the meantime, Patience is strict in their mission: Evergreen must be defended. Evergreen must persevere.
